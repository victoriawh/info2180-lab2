		<h2>The Ultimate Sacrifice: Jesus Died for Our Sins</h2> 
		<h4><time datetime="2024-10-7">October 7, 2024</time> by Victoria Whyte</h4>
		<p> One of the central messages of Christianity is the profound act of love and sacrifice that Jesus Christ made on the cross. His death was 		not just a historical event; it was the fulfillment of God’s plan to redeem humanity from sin. According to the Bible, sin separates us from 		God, leading to spiritual death. But through Jesus' willing sacrifice, the penalty for sin was paid once and for all. On the cross, Jesus 		bore the weight of all humanity's wrongdoings—past, present, and future. His crucifixion was not only a moment of immense physical suffering 		but also a spiritual exchange, where the sinless Son of God took our place. </p>

His sacrifice opened the door to forgiveness, freedom, and a restored 			relationship with God for all who believe. This incredible act of grace serves as a reminder that no matter how far we have strayed, God’s 		love is greater than our failures. Through Jesus’ death and resurrection, we are offered new life and an eternal connection with Him </br>
		John 3:16 </br>
		For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life </p>

		<h2> Trusting God </h2>
		<h4><time datetime="2024-10-7">October 7, 2024</time> by Victoria Whyte</h4>
		<p>The story of Lot’s wife, found in the book of Genesis, serves as a powerful lesson about obedience and trust in God. When God decided to 		destroy the sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, He sent angels to warn Lot and his family, urging them to flee without looking back. 			Despite the clear instructions, Lot’s wife disobeyed and turned back to look at the city as it was being destroyed. In that moment, she was 		turned into a pillar of salt, forever symbolizing the consequences of clinging to the past.</p>

		<p><img class="float-left" src= "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518110925495-5fe2fda0442c?q=80&w=2070						&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"> Lot’s wife represents the danger of looking 		back at what God has called us to leave behind. Her story reminds us that when we follow God, we must do so wholeheartedly, 				without hesitation or regret. It challenges us to trust in God’s plan for our future and to avoid being stuck in the comfort of what we 		know, even if it no longer serves us. Lot’s wife’s fate encourages us to keep their eyes fixed on God’s promises and to move forward with 		faith.</br> 
		Luke 17:32</br>
		Jesus said, "Remember Lot's wife."</p>
